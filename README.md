### The top 100 most popular satellites

using the TLE api we have collected the top 100 satellites to be explored and see the data associated to each satellite!

![image3](https://github.com/CaidynGinger/SatelliteVision/blob/main/ImagesForReadMe/Dashboard_Page.png)
### Feature 1

The dashboard contains charts and maps the 
- The first chart shows the satellites launched each year
- The second chart shows the satellites revaluations per day over the satellites revolutions total
- The map shows the locations of 20 satellites

### Feature 2

The Comparison page contains a satellite list where you can add up to 4 satellites and view their respective data sets in relation to one another

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Utilized React `Charts.JS` dependency for Data visualization
* Implemented Routing with `React-Router v6`.
* API End Point: [link Here](https://tle.ivanstanojevic.me/#/) 

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* What was good about this project, what did you learn.
* What aspects did you enjoy.
* 

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* understanding how data is passed from one component to the next and how pointers to functions work


#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Creating Reusable components in react.

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->

* turn the satellite locations map into a live and constantly updating ui element.

<!-- MOCKUPS -->
